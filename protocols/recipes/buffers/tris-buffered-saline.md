## Overview
Tris (trishydroxymethylaminomethane) $(HOCH_2)_3CNH_2$ has an effective buffer range between 7.1 and 9.1 (pKa 8.07 at $25 ^\circ C$)

### Uses
Wash buffer in Western Blots

## Components
- $diH_2O$
- *Trizma HCl*
- $NaCl$
- $HCl$
- $Methanol$

## Protocol

### 10x stock solution
We will be preparing 1L of 10x TBS for a stock solution

1. Add 800 mL of $diH_2O$ to orange top container
2. Dissolve 24.23 g of *Trizma HCl* and 80.06 g $NaCl$ into the container
3. Titrate the pH with $HCl$ to 7.6
4. Add $diH_2O$ to bring the total volume to 1 L

### 1x TBS solution with 20% methanol
using the 10x solution described above

1. Add 100 mL of *10x TBS solution* to an orange top container
2. Add 700 mL of $diH_2O$
3. Add 200 mL of $Methanol$
