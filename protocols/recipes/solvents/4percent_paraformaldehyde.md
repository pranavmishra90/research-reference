# 4% Paraformaldehyde (10% Formalin)

## Overview

The term "Formalin" specifically refers to a saturated solution of Formaldehyde, which is 37% w/v or about 40% v/v. This is a rather high concentration of formaldehyde. A common dilution is a 1:10, which is referred to as *10% Formalin* or *4% Formaldehyde (aka 4% Paraformaldehyde)*. "Paraformaldehyde" technically refers to a polymerized form of formaldehyde which is stable at room temperature without the addition of methanol. Upon addition to an aqueous solution, it dissolves into formaldehyde by breaking the polymer chain.

### Uses
Fixing tissue

## Components
1. $diH_20$
2. $HCl$ (Dilute)
3. $NaOH$  (1 N)
4. Paraformaldehyde powder (Sigma Aldrich Cat 158127-500G)
5. 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline
6. Sterile container


## Protocol: Preparation of 1 liter of 4% PFA (10% Formalin)
1. In a vented hood, add 800 mL of PBS to a beaker with a stir bar on a hot plate set to $60 ^\circ C$
2. Add 40g of PFA powder to the heated PBS solution
3. Spin until mostly disolved
4. Raise the pH, dropwise, by adding 1N $NaOH$ until the solution clears
5. Cool to room temperature
6. Add 1x PBS until the volume reaches 1L total


## Storage
- Ideally, this should be prepared fresh for each use
- $2-8 ^\circ C$: 1 month
- $-20 ^\circ C$: several months
