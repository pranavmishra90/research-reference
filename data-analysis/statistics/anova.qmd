## Pre-ANOVA testing

### Levene test

A test which sees if the variance found in each group / sample is equal to that of the other ones.

Input: quantitative variables - 2+

Which test(s) are we hoping to perform later:

-   One-way ANOVA
-   T-test for independent samples

Why is the Levene test important?

If the each group / sample has a large difference in their sample sizes, you need to make sure that the varience in each group are roughly the same. This is called *homogeneity*. Without homogeneous variances between groups of different sizes, the ANOVA could give you a false result of significance [@van_den_berg_levenes_2023].
