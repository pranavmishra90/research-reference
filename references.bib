To comprehensively document spatial gene expression technologies and data-analysis methods, we present a curated review of literature on spatial transcriptomics dating back to 1987, along with a thorough analysis of trends in the field, such as usage of experimental techniques, species, tissues studied, and computational approaches used.

The performance of methods targeting the {polyA} tails of {mRNA} relies on the availability of specimens with high {RNA} quality. Moreover, the high cost of currently available spatial resolved transcriptomics assays requires a careful sample screening process to increase the chance of obtaining high-quality data. Indeed, the upfront analysis of {RNA} quality can show considerable variability due to sample handling, storage, and/or intrinsic factors. We present {RNA}-Rescue Spatial Transcriptomics ({RRST}), a workflow designed to improve {mRNA} recovery from fresh frozen specimens with moderate to low {RNA} quality. First, we provide a benchmark of {RRST} against the standard Visium spatial gene expression protocol on high {RNA} quality samples represented by mouse brain and prostate cancer samples. Then, we test the {RRST} protocol on tissue sections collected from five challenging tissue types, including human lung, colon, small intestine, pediatric brain tumor, and mouse bone/cartilage. In total, we analyze 52 tissue sections and demonstrate that {RRST} is a versatile, powerful, and reproducible protocol for fresh frozen specimens of different qualities and origins.},

The total {RNA} from different parts of the gut (rat: proximal and distal small intestine, caecum, colon and rectum, human: colon and rectum) and individual gut layers (muscle and submucosal/mucosal) was extracted. The quality of the {RNA} was assessed by micro capillary electrophoresis. The {RNA} quality was expressed by the {RNA} integrity number which is calculated from the relative height and area of the 18 S and 28 S {RNA} peaks. From rat distal small intestine {qPCR} was performed for neuronal and glial markers., {RESULTS}: {RNA} obtained from smooth muscle tissue is much longer stable than those from submucosal/mucosal tissue. At {RT} muscle {RNA} degrades after one day, on ice it is stable at least three days. Cleaning and separation of gut layers before storage and use of {RNALater}, maintains the stability of muscle {RNA} at {RT} for much longer periods. Different parts of the gut show varying degradation periods. {RNA} obtained from the submucosal/mucosal layer always showed a much worse amplification rate than {RNA} from muscle tissue. In general {RNA} harvested from rat tissue, either smooth muscle layer or submucosal/mucosal layer is much longer stable than {RNA} from human gut tissue, and {RNA} obtained from smooth muscle tissue shows an increased stability compared to {RNA} from submucosal/mucosal tissue. At {RT} muscle {RNA} degrades after one day, while the stability on ice lasts at least three days. Cleaning and separation of gut layers before storage and use of {RNALater}, maintains the stability of muscle {RNA} at {RT} for much longer periods. Different parts of the gut show varying degradation periods. The {RNA} from muscle and submucosal/mucosal tissue of the proximal small intestine degrades much faster than the {RNA} of distal small intestine, caecum or colon with rectum. {RNA} obtained from the submucosal/mucosal layer always showed a much more reduced amplification rate than {RNA} from muscle tissue [β-Tubulin {III} for muscle quantification cycle (Cp): 22.07 ± 0.25, for β-Tubulin {III} submucosal/mucosal Cp: 27.42 ± 0.19]., {CONCLUSION}: Degradation of intestinal {mRNA} depends on preparation and storage conditions of the tissue. Cooling, rinsing and separating of intestinal tissue reduce the degradation of {mRNA}.},

	abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics ({scRNA}-seq) has become essential for biomedical research over the past decade, particularly in developmental biology, cancer, immunology, and neuroscience. Most commercially available {scRNA}-seq protocols require cells to be recovered intact and viable from tissue. This has precluded many cell types from study and largely destroys the spatial context that could otherwise inform analyses of cell identity and function. An increasing number of commercially available platforms now facilitate spatially resolved, high-dimensional assessment of gene transcription, known as ‘spatial transcriptomics’. Here, we introduce different classes of method, which either record the locations of hybridized {mRNA} molecules in tissue, image the positions of cells themselves prior to assessment, or employ spatial arrays of {mRNA} probes of pre-determined location. We review sizes of tissue area that can be assessed, their spatial resolution, and the number and types of genes that can be profiled. We discuss if tissue preservation influences choice of platform, and provide guidance on whether specific platforms may be better suited to discovery screens or hypothesis testing. Finally, we introduce bioinformatic methods for analysing spatial transcriptomic data, including pre-processing, integration with existing {scRNA}-seq data, and inference of cell-cell interactions. Spatial -omics methods are already improving our understanding of human tissues in research, diagnostic, and therapeutic settings. To build upon these recent advancements, we provide entry-level guidance for those seeking to employ spatial transcriptomics in their own biomedical research.},

	abstract = {Background: Next generation sequencing ({NGS})-based multi-gene panel tests have been performed to predict the treatment response and prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer ({CRC}). Whether the multi-gene mutation results of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ({FFPE}) tissues are identical to those of fresh frozen tissues remains unknown., Methods: A 22-gene panel with 103 hotspots was used to detect mutations in paired fresh frozen tissue and {FFPE} tissue from 118 patients with {CRC}., Results: In our study, 117 patients (99.2\%) had one or more variants, with 226 variants in {FFPE} tissue and 221 in fresh frozen tissue. Of the 129 variants identified in this study, 96 variants were present in both {FFPE} and fresh frozen tissues; 27 variants were found in {FFPE} tissues only; 6 variants were found only in fresh frozen tissues. The mutation results demonstrated {\textgreater}94.0\% concordance in all variants, with Kappa coefficient {\textgreater}0.500 in 64.3\% (83/129) of variants. At the gene level, concordance ranged from 73.8 to 100.0\%, with Kappa coefficient {\textgreater}0.500 in 81.3\% (13/16) of genes., Conclusions: The results of mutation analysis performed with a multi-gene panel and {FFPE} and fresh frozen tissue were highly concordant in patients with {CRC}, at both the variant and gene levels. There were, however, some important differences in mutation results between the two tissue types. Therefore, fresh frozen tissue should not routinely be replaced with {FFPE} tissue for mutation analysis with a multi-gene panel. Rather, {FFPE} tissue is a reasonable alternative for fresh frozen tissue when the latter is unavailable.},

	abstract = {The contribution of cellular heterogeneity and architecture to white adipose tissue ({WAT}) function is poorly understood. Herein, we combined spatially resolved transcriptional profiling with single-cell {RNA} sequencing and image analyses to map human {WAT} composition and structure. This identified 18 cell classes with unique propensities to form spatially organized homo- and heterotypic clusters. Of these, three constituted mature adipocytes that were similar in size, but distinct in their spatial arrangements and transcriptional profiles. Based on marker genes, we termed these {AdipoLEP}, {AdipoPLIN}, and {AdipoSAA}. We confirmed, in independent datasets, that their respective gene profiles associated differently with both adipocyte and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Corroborating our observations, insulin stimulation in vivo by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp showed that only {AdipoPLIN} displayed a transcriptional response to insulin. Altogether, by mining this multimodal resource we identify that human {WAT} is composed of three classes of mature adipocytes, only one of which is insulin responsive.},

We demonstrate that {MUSE} can discover tissue subpopulations missed by either modality as well as compensate for modality-specific noise. We apply {MUSE} to diverse datasets containing spatial transcriptomics ({seqFISH}+, {STARmap} or Visium) and imaging (hematoxylin and eosin or fluorescence microscopy) modalities. {MUSE} identified biologically meaningful tissue subpopulations and stereotyped spatial patterning in healthy brain cortex and intestinal tissues. In diseased tissues, {MUSE} revealed gene biomarkers for proximity to tumor region and heterogeneity of amyloid precursor protein processing across Alzheimer brain regions. {MUSE} enables the integration of multi-modal data to provide insights into the states, functions and organization of cells in complex biological tissues.},

	abstract = {Molecular tools for tissue profiling, such as expression microarrays and real-time {PCR}, generally require collection of fresh frozen tissues as sources of high-quality {RNA}. The fragile nature of {RNA} prompted us to examine the effects of storage time and transport conditions with regard to {RNA} integrity and gene expression in nonfixed surgical human specimens. At surgery, fresh normal tonsil and colon tissue was cut into pieces and snap frozen. Additional fresh tissue pieces were (i) left at room temperature, (ii) kept on ice, (iii) in normal saline or (iv) in a commercial {RNA}-stabilizing buffer ({RNAlater}) and snap frozen after 0.5, 1, 3, 6 and 16 h. Structural {RNA} integrity was analysed by microchip electrophoresis. Surprisingly, {RNA} remained stable in both tissue types under all conditions tested for up to 6–16 h. Gene expression by real-time {PCR} of cfos, {HIF}1α, Bcl2, {PCNA}, {TGFβ}1 and {SMAD}7 was analysed at different storage time points in tonsil tissue. Expression levels were essentially stable when samples were kept on ice, while marked regulation of single genes was observed during storage at room temperature, in normal saline and in {RNAlater}. Furthermore, we analysed selected tissue types from the local biobank representing 47 normal and malignant tissues transported on ice for up to 2–3 h before biobanking. {RNA} prepared from 45 of the 47 samples exhibited distinct ribosomal peaks indicating intact {RNA}. This study shows that {RNA} degradation is a minor problem during handling of fresh human tissue before biobanking. Our data indicate that nonfixed tissue specimens may be transported on ice for hours without any major influence on {RNA} quality and expression of the selected genes. However, further studies are warranted to clarify the impact of transport logistics on global gene expression.},
