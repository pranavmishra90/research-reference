## Pre-ANOVA testing

### Levene test

A test which sees if the variance found in each group / sample is equal
to that of the other ones.

Input: quantitative variables - 2+

Which test(s) are we hoping to perform later:

- One-way ANOVA
- T-test for independent samples

Why is the Levene test important?

If the each group / sample has a large difference in their sample sizes,
you need to make sure that the varience in each group are roughly the
same. This is called *homogeneity*. Without homogeneous variances
between groups of different sizes, the ANOVA could give you a false
result of significance<sup>1</sup>.
