# 10% Formalin (4% Paraformaldehyde)

Thursday, October 12, 2023

## Overview

The term “Formalin” specifically refers to a saturated solution of
Formaldehyde, which is 37% w/v or about 40% v/v. This is a rather high
concentration of formaldehyde. A common dilution is a 1:10, which is
referred to as *10% Formalin* or *4% Formaldehyde (aka 4%
Paraformaldehyde)*. “Paraformaldehyde” technically refers to a
polymerized form of formaldehyde which is stable at room temperature
without the addition of methanol. Upon addition to an aqueous solution,
it dissolves into formaldehyde by breaking the polymer chain.

### Uses

Fixing tissue

## Components

1.  ![diH_2O](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?diH_2O "diH_2O")
2.  ![HCl](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?HCl "HCl") (Dilute)
3.  ![NaOH](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?NaOH "NaOH") (1 N)
4.  Paraformaldehyde powder (Sigma Aldrich Cat 158127-500G)
5.  1X Phosphate Buffered Saline
6.  Sterile container

## Protocol: Preparation of 1 liter of 4% PFA (10% Formalin)

Adapted from<sup>1</sup>

1.  In a vented hood, add 800 mL of PBS to a beaker with a stir bar on a
    hot plate set to
    ![60 ^\circ C](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?60%20%5E%5Ccirc%20C "60 ^\circ C")
2.  Add 40g of PFA powder to the heated PBS solution
3.  Spin until mostly disolved [^1]
4.  Raise the pH, by adding 1N
    ![NaOH](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?NaOH "NaOH") dropwise
    using a transfer pipette, until the solution clears [^2]
5.  Cool to room temperature
6.  Add 1x PBS until the volume reaches 1L total

## Storage

- Ideally, this should be prepared fresh for each use
- ![2-8 ^\circ C](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?2-8%20%5E%5Ccirc%20C "2-8 ^\circ C"):
  1 month
- ![-20 ^\circ C](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?-20%20%5E%5Ccirc%20C "-20 ^\circ C"):
  several months

    ![\le](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cle "\le") 2 mL of 1N
    ![NaOH](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?NaOH "NaOH") to turn
    the solution clear.
