## Overview

<!-- Description of chemical here -->

### Uses

Tween-20 is a non-ionic detergent which acts as a temporary blocking
agent to prevent non-specific protein-protein binding. In western blots,
after the primary antibody has been allowed to bind appropriately, we
need to prepare for the secondary antibody. First, we must wash the
membrane to remove all excess primary antibody. By washing the membrane
with a detergent, we prevent the primary antibody from inadventantly,
incorrectly binding to an incorrect site (non-specific binding to the
membrane). The antibody will have a preferential binding to the
detergent.

Detergents are helpful temporary blockers - they can be washed away
easily with aqeuous solutions.

## Components

- *10x Stock TBS*
- *Tween 20*
- ![diH\\2O](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?diH%5C_2O "diH\_2O")

## Protocol

Adapted from (<sup>1</sup>) 1. Add 800 mL of
![diH\\2O](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?diH%5C_2O "diH\_2O") to
orange top container 2. Add 1 mL of *Tween 20* using a wide tip pipette
(Tween 20 is very viscous) 3. Add ~199 mL of
![diH\\2O](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?diH%5C_2O "diH\_2O")
down the side of the container until the total volume reaches 1 L

## Notes

Do not start with a 1x TBS that we may keep at the bench. This will have
20% Methanol added, which we do not want for TBST.
